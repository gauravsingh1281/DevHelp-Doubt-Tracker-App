## üß™ Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Authentication Setup
1. **Register Student:**

   - Creates a student account with email: `student@example.com`

2. **Register Mentor:**
   - Run "Register Mentor" request
   - Creates a mentor account with email: `mentor@example.com`

3. **Login Student:**
   - Run "Login Student" request
   - Automatically saves student token to `student_token` variable
   - Sets `auth_token` to student token for subsequent requests

4. **Login Mentor:**
   - Run "Login Mentor" request
   - Automatically saves mentor token to `mentor_token` variable

### Step 2: Doubts Testing
1. **Create Doubt (as Student):**
   - Run "Create Doubt (Student)" request

2. **Get My Doubts (as Student):**
   - Run "Get My Doubts (Student)" request
   - Verifies student can see their own doubts

3. **Get All Doubts (as Mentor):**
   - Run "Get All Doubts (Mentor)" request

## ‚úÖ Automated Tests

Each request includes automated tests that verify:

### Authentication Tests
- Status codes (200, 201, 401, 403)
- Response structure validation
- Token presence and format
- User role verification

### Doubts Tests
- CRUD operations success
- Authorization (student vs mentor access)
- Data validation
- Status transitions

### Comments Tests
- Comment creation and nesting
- Author permissions
- Content validation
- Hierarchical structure

### Error Scenarios
- Invalid credentials
- Missing authentication
- Role-based access control
- Data validation errors

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running All Tests

### Method 1: Collection Runner
1. Click on "DevHelp - Doubt Tracker App API" collection
2. Click "Run collection" 
3. Select all folders
4. Click "Run DevHelp - Doubt Tracker App API"

### Method 2: Individual Testing
1. Start with "Authentication" folder
2. Run each request in sequence
3. Move to "Doubts Management"
4. Then "Comments Management"
5. Finally "Error Scenarios"

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Response Validation
- All requests include response time checks (< 2000ms)
- Content-Type validation
- Status code verification
- Data structure validation

### Console Logging
- Pre-request scripts log the request URL
- Test results are displayed in Test Results tab
- Variables are automatically updated and logged

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for failed requests
- Detailed validation of error responses
- Proper HTTP status code testing

## üìù Notes

### File Upload Testing
- The "Create Doubt with Screenshot" request includes a file upload field

- You may need to wait between requests if hitting limits

### Database State
- Tests are designed to be run in sequence
- Each test builds upon the previous one's data
- Variables are automatically managed between requests

### Environment Configuration
- Default configuration assumes server running on `localhost:3000`
- Modify `base_url` in environment for different setups
- All tokens are automatically managed

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Endpoints
1. Add new request to appropriate folder
2. Include proper authentication headers
3. Add test scripts for validation
4. Update variables as needed

### Modifying Test Data
